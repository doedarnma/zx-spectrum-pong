# Pong Overload
With the code being extremely long and probably very confusing, I added comments in hope it will clarify at least a portion of what my brain did
on this project! I used ZXSpin to emulate it, and the knowledge and motivation I gained at Petnica to create this program. You are free to download the code
and run it in said emulator to play the game: player 1 moves up with A key, down with S key; player 2 moves up with K key, down with L key and press SPACE to start moving the ball.

The design is very similar to the original 8-bit Pong we all know and (some, not me) remember, with added colors and flashy screens so it looks more friendly
and approachable:

It works well, with only a few bugs if you really make an effort in finding them. Other than that, the project is definitelly
unfinished. My plan for the future is to add some kind of points system, and to fix my bizarre method of finding the reflecting angle of the ball, as well as
adding variety to angles (for now the ball only reflects at a 90 degree angle, 180 if you're lucky) so the game becomes more fun.

Programming in this emulator (which is as reasonably buggy as my code) and in this language was, admittedly, a struggling experience, resulting in many sleepless
nights and dreams of my environment turned into assembly code, but also a very fun one. Knowing I made a game everyone in their lifetime once enjoyed in a
difficult programming language like this one really boosted my confidence for future projects.
